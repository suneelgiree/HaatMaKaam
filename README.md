# HaatMaKaam - Decentralized Service Marketplace

"HaatMaKaam" is a decentralized, hourly-based service marketplace for everyday skilled laborers in Nepal (e.g., plumbers, electricians, carpenters, masons, drivers, cleaners, tutors, tailors, mechanics, photographers, cooks, etc.). Users (clients) can post needs, and service providers (workers) can register, get verified, and take up jobs based on proximity and availability.
